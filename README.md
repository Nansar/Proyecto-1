# Proyecto-1

In this project, I am recreating a web page for Circle : A digital design and development studio.

In this project, you may find, a Home page, a Services section, A Contact page and a Project page, along with a 404 page when clicking on the Services link from the navigation bar of the Project Page.

So I started initially by creating the HTML documents, which I didn' have too much trouble with.

Then followed the CSS documents, and Javascript.

At the moment, the javascript code is not totally on point but what I had big trouble with was CSS.

What was most complicated for me was the fact that everything changes with CSS just as long as you edit a small property and I find it difficult to know your way to the final rendering when everything becomes chaos in the code.
